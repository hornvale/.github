[**Hornvale**](https://github.com/hornvale/hornvale) is an experimental open-world text adventure game.

My current ideas are the result of an iterative process with me banging my head against one wall after another for several years. So this repository has some archived versions of previous incarnations:
- [2022](https://github.com/hornvale/hornvale-2022)
- [2023](https://github.com/hornvale/hornvale-2023)
- [2024](https://github.com/hornvale/hornvale-2024)

None are in a very functional state, but at least give some idea of where I was trying to go.
